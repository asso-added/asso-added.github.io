  <p>
    In order to help the doctors in their professional insertion, 
    three PhD associations in Normandy 
    (<strong><a href="http://assoc-optic.fr/?lang=fr">OPTIC</a></strong>,
    <strong> <a href="http://www.assonormadoc.fr/">NormaDoc</a> </strong>et
     <strong><a href="{{site.url}}/index-{{page.lang}}">ADDED</a></strong>) 
     took the initiation to organize a trip to national job forums. These 
     forums allow gathering PhD students, young researchers and also other 
     enterprises who are looking for recruiting
